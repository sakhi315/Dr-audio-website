        <h2>Study Purpose</h2>
        <p>The Dr. Audio project was developed to address the challenges that many low socioeconomic parents, teachers, and K-12 students face in accessing educational resources and support. We recognized that many children lack motivation and encouragement at home, and parents often struggle to find credible, accessible strategies to help their children succeed academically. In many cases, parents and teachers are overwhelmed by the amount of information online or simply unaware of tools that can help them foster confidence and curiosity in children.

To better understand these needs, we conducted three rounds of research using surveys targeted at our user base. In the first round, we received four responses that helped us identify general needs and expectations. Parents and teachers wanted a space where they could connect with others, access interactive content, and learn more about child development and encouragement. Based on that feedback, we created low-fidelity wireframes of a homepage, a blog feature, and a podcast-focused layout. In our second round, we received eleven responses that suggested using child-friendly colors, adding search filters, and offering downloadable resources. These suggestions shaped our high-fidelity mockups. In our third round of testing with thirteen users, we received largely positive feedback. Users appreciated the clean layout, interactivity, and features like the newsletter pop-up. However, some felt that the live speakers page was unnecessary and that the homepage needed to feel more personal. Based on that, we made final improvements before moving to implementation.</p>

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
<p>Here are the initial wireframes that guided our website development:</p>

        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>Our solution was to create an engaging and informative website called Dr. Audio that serves as a central platform for parents, teachers, and students. The website features podcast episodes from the Young and Hungry Podcast, a blog section for user-submitted stories and advice, and a downloadable resources section. The goal was to make educational support more accessible, particularly for underserved communities, by offering it through a platform that is visually appealing, easy to use, and designed with their needs in mind.

The implementation process began with translating our research into low-fidelity and then high-fidelity wireframes using Figma. After incorporating user feedback, we developed the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We focused on building a responsive and interactive experience with features such as a newsletter sign-up that users are prompted to complete before exploring the rest of the site. We also implemented a blog submission form that allows parents and teachers to share their stories, and pop-up modals that enhance user interaction without overwhelming the page layout. Once the initial development was complete, we tested the site again and made final adjustments to the layout, pop-up behavior, and navigation flow based on user experience. The final deliverable is a fully functional, publicly hosted website that demonstrates our research, design thinking, and implementation process in action.</p>
